National Park Weather and Event App 


This application leverages the openweathermap.org and National Park Service APIs to aggregate information for National Parks.  
The user selects a new search or previous searchs(if any).  If this is a new service the user is presented with a list of states which results in a list of National Parks.   The user then selects a park.  The app then displays current weather in the park, a four day forecast, information regarding park alerts, campgrounds, and available activities.  If the user selects a previous search the same information is presented without the selection process.
